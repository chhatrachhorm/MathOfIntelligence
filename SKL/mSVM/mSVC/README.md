### Overview
  Support Vector Machines are a set of supervised learning 
methods for classification, regression and outliers detection.
1. Classification
    * The followings are classes capable of performing multi-class 
    classification on a dataset.
        * SVC
        * NuSVC
        * LinearSVC
